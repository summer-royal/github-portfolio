# Summer's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases my projects and coding samples, demonstrating my skills and expertise in C++ and python. It serves as a comprehensive overview of my work and accomplishments as a software engineer intern.

## Projects

### Neural Network with Backpropagation Algorithm for XOR Problem

- Description: This C++ program implements a neural network with backpropagation algorithm to solve the XOR problem. The XOR problem is a classic problem in neural network literature, where the goal is to predict the output of an XOR gate given two binary inputs.
- Repository Link: https://github.com/summer-royal/neural_network_for_xor.git

### Deep Learning for Recidivism Prediction
- Description: This python program implements a neural network model for predicting recidivism using the COMPAS dataset. The model is trained and evaluated on the dataset, and hyperparameter tuning is performed to find the best-performing model.

### Logistic Regression Model for Gender Prediction

- Description: This code implements logistic regression using word embeddings for gender prediction. It uses pre-trained word vectors from the GloVe word embedding model.

## Skills

- Programming languages: C, C++, Python, HTML, Java
- I have experience working with data structures, website development, app development, machine learning, deep learning, and data mining.

## Education

- I am currently studying Computer Science and Biomedical Computation at Stanford University
- Expected Graduation: 2025

## Experience

- During the summer of 2022, I worked as a software engineer intern at Argo AI. Argo AI was an autonomous vehicle company that builds software, hardware, maps, and cloud-support infrastructure. I worked on the System Fault Detection & Management Team, worked with Machine Learning Team to generate and process new data for SFDM-related models, created C++ and Python programs to process and analyze log data, and developed queries, reports, and data visualizations to support the needs of various teams.
- From 09/2021 to 05/2022, I worked for Breakout Mentors as a computer science instructor providing personalized python instruction to students.
